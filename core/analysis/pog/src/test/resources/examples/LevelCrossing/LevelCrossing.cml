-- Gate and controller

-- The last components of our system are a controller and the gate.
-- The duties of the controller
-- are to ensure that the gate is always down when there is a train on the
-- gate, and that it is up whenever prudent.


-- When the gate is up, the controller does nothing until the sensor
-- detects an approaching train.  
-- In this state, time is allowed to pass arbitrarily, except that the
-- signal for the gate to go down is sent immediately on the occurrence of
-- the sensor event.

begin
  actions
    ControllerUp =
      sensor.<inseg> -> gate!<godown> -> ControllerGoingDown(1)
      []
      sensor.<outseg> -> ERROR
      []
      tock -> ControllerUp

    ControllerGoingDown = n: TRACKSEGS @
      ( if GateSeg < n then ERROR else sensor.<inseg> -> ControllerGoingDown(n+1) )
      []  gate.<down> -> ControllerDown(n)

-- The two states ControllerGoingDown and ControllerDown 
-- both keep a record of how many trains
-- have to pass before the gate may go up.  Each time the sensor event
-- occurs this count is increased.
-- The count should not get greater than the number of trains that
-- can legally be between the sensor and the gate (which equals the
-- number of track segments).
-- The ControllerGoingDown state comes to an end when the gate.down event occurs
              
-- When the gate is down, the occurrence of a train entering its sector
-- causes no alarm, and each time a train leaves the gate sector the
-- remaining count goes down, or the gate is signalled to go up, as appropriate.
-- Time is allowed to pass arbitrarily in this state, except that the
-- direction to the gate to go up is instantaneous when due.

-- When the gate is going up, the inward sensor may still fire, which means that
-- the gate must be signalled to go down again.
-- Otherwise the gate goes up after UpTime units.

-- Any process will be allowed to generate an error event, and since we will
-- be establishing that these do not occur, we can make the successor process
-- anything we please, in this case STOP.

-- The following are the times we assume here for the gate to go up
-- and go down.  They represent upper bounds in each case.
