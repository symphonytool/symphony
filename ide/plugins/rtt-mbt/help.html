  <h2>RT-Plugin User Manual</h2>
  <p>This user manual describes the RT-Tester plugin for Eclipse.
  It does not contain detailed information about the concepts behind
  model based testing with RT-Tester, but it describes how to use the
  plugin and how to setup and configure test projects, test procedures
  and the RT-Tester backend server to use.</p>

  <h2>RTT-MBT Manual</h2>
  <p>This introduction to RT-Tester Model Based Testing (RTT-MBT) has
  been developed using the modeling tool Enterprise Architect and the
  RT-Tester GUI, not the RTT-plugin to Eclipse. The concepts and processes
  for model based testing with RT-Tester are independent of the GUI that
  is used.</p>

  <h2>RT-Tester Manual</h2>
  <p>The RT-Tester Tool is used as the standard back-end for model based
  testing with RTT-MBT. The test procedures that are generated by RTT-MBT
  are by default expressed using RT-Tester Test Language (RTTL) and
  RT-Tester test environment and test procedure configuration mechanisms.
  The RT-Tester manual contains detailed information about RTTL, RT-Tester
  test projects/environments and test procedure configuration.</p>
